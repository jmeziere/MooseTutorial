Kernel Example

For this example, we will use the diffusion problem. To jog your memory, the PDE for this is

$\nabla^2 u = 0$

After finding the weak form, we find that this equation is transformed to

$\int_{\Omega} \nabla \psi_i \cdot \nabla u d\Omega$

or, in inner product notation,

$\left(\nabla \psi_i,\nabla u \right)$

This example is also presented in https://mooseframework.inl.gov/workshop/#/18/5.
