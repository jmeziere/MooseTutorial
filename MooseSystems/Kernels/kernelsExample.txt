Kernel Example

For this example, we will use the diffusion problem. To jog your memory, the PDE for this is

$\nabla^2 u = 0$

After finding the weak form, we find that this equation is transformed to

$\int_{\Omega} \nabla \psi_i \cdot \nabla u \quad d\Omega - \int_{\partial\Omega} \psi_i \nabla u \cdot \hat{n} \quad d\partial\Omega$

or, in inner product notation,

$\left(\nabla \psi_i,\nabla u \right) - \left< \psi_i, \nabla u \cdot \hat{n} \right>$

Since we only care about the volume integral for the kernels, we will only implement the first term in this example. The second term would be implemented in a boundary condition file.
This example is also presented in https://mooseframework.inl.gov/workshop/#/18/5.

The following are the files that need to be included for this to work.
