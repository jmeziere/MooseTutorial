Kernel Solution

For this problem, the PDE we will use is the Darcy Pressure equation. The Darcy Pressure equation has the follwing form.

$-\nabla \frac{K}{\mu} \nabla p = 0$

where
$K \text{ is the permeability tensor}$
$\mu \text{ is the fluid viscosity}$

For our problem, we will assume that the permeability tensor is just a scalar value.
After finding the weak form, we find that this equation is transformed to

$\int_{\Omega} \frac{K}{\mu} \nabla \psi_i \cdot \nabla p \quad d\Omega - \int_{\partial\Omega} \psi_i \frac{K}{\mu} \nabla p \cdot \hat{n} \quad d\partial\Omega$

or, in inner product notation,

$\left(\frac{K}{\mu} \nabla \psi_i,\nabla p \right) - \left<\frac{K}{\mu} \psi_i, \nabla p \cdot \hat{n} \right>$

Since we only care about the volume integral for the kernels, we will only implement the first term in this example. The second term would be implemented in a boundary condition file.
This example is also presented in https://mooseframework.inl.gov/workshop/index.html#/15/1.
