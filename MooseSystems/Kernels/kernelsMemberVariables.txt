Kernel Member Variables

There are several member objects that have been defined that are necessary for the program to work properly. These are defined in the table below. It is important that you use these variables when they are necessary and not try to create your own as MOOSE expects these.

Table
Member Object|Description
_u|Value of the variable this Kernel is operating on
_grad_u|Gradient of the variable this Kernel is operating on
_phi|Value of the test functions at the quadrature point
_grad_phi|Gradient of the test functions at the quadrature points
_q_point|Coordinates of the current quadrature point
_i|Current index for the test functions
_j|Current index for the trial functions
_qp|Current quadrature point index
End
