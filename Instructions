After editing any code, you will need to compile the code.
Where what you change is will determine what you need to compile.
I haven't changed anything above the phase-field module file locations, but you should be able to run make -j number, where number is an integer representing the number of cores that you want to use.
This should be done under projects/moose/framework, or possibly projects/moose/test.
Also, you will need to run make under projects/moose/modules/phase_field.

Actually running the code in MOOSE requires an input file.
This file tells MOOSE which code should be run and in what way.
Examples of these files are in projects/moose/modules/phase_field/examples/grain_growth
Any of these will do.
What you will add to this file is under the materials block.
You'll see something like this:

[Materials]
  [./CuGrGr]
    # Material properties
    type = GBEvolution # Quantitative material properties for copper grain growth.  Dimensions are nm and ns
    GBmob0 = 2.5e-6 #Mobility prefactor for Cu from Schonfelder1997
    GBenergy = 0.708 #GB energy for Cu from Schonfelder1997
    Q = 0.23 #Activation energy for grain growth from Schonfelder 1997
    T = 450 # K   #Constant temperature of the simulation (for mobility calculation)
    wGB = 14 # nm      #Width of the diffuse GB
  [../]
[]

After you add what you need, it will look something like this:

[Materials]
  [./Location]
    type = GBEBLocation #This is the name of your C and h files
    s = 20 #This is an optional parameter you don't need to have in here, but can if you choose
  [../]
  [./CuGrGr]
    # Material properties
    type = GBEvolution # Quantitative material properties for copper grain growth.  Dimensions are nm and ns
    GBmob0 = 2.5e-6 #Mobility prefactor for Cu from Schonfelder1997
    GBenergy = 0.708 #GB energy for Cu from Schonfelder1997
    Q = 0.23 #Activation energy for grain growth from Schonfelder 1997
    T = 450 # K   #Constant temperature of the simulation (for mobility calculation)
    wGB = 14 # nm      #Width of the diffuse GB
  [../]

Once your input file is complete, you will either run it from the command line or peacock (for peacock to work, it needs to be in your path).
To run it from the command line, run the following code:  [path to phase_field-opt] -i [path to input file]
To run it with peacock, run the following code: peacock -i [path to input file] 
If you run it with peacock, it is important to remember that you must be in a directory where phase_field-opt is or lower, as it searches upward for the executable.
Running the peacock code will open up a gui. To run the code, you go to the execute tab, and click run.
